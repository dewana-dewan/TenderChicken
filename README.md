# TenderChicken

TenderChicken is a smart-contract based decentralized application which allows different organisations to release tenders 
for procurement of any kind of goods or services. TenderChicken prevents organisations from tampering or looking into the 
contents of the contracts submitted by various contractors for a given tender under a fixed deadline.

TenderChicken brings fairness and decentralization in the process of goods/services procurement.

Proposed Model :-

1. An organisation launches a tender.
2. Contractors are asked to submit the hash of their applications(contracts) onto the server until a fixed deadline.
3. These hashes gets stored in a smart contract mapped with the Contractor's ID.
4. Once the deadline is over, contractors are asked to submit original documents which are then verified with their previous 
hashes.
5.  The contract with the lowest bid satisfying the specifiactions is selected automatically and sent to the organisation.
